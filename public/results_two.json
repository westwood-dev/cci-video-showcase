We 3D printed a hinge for the servos, connecting multiple servos together in an alternating pattern to create the form of a snake slithering, working to code its behavior to create a smooth, snake-like circular motion to represent Ouroboros allowing the Audience to attach their own interpretation of its cyclical movements.",
      "insights": "We gained a lot of insight on 3D printing, working with servos and its driver, and utilising Adafruit to effectively create our own little robot. With more time to improve the physical design of the snake, as well as coding improvements on the accuracy of its behaviour, we believe the process of creating Ourobotos was an effective glimpse into an effective way of exploring synthetic psychology and furthering our knowledge of creative computing.",

The arm pushed forewards and backwards reacting to the ultrasonic sensor, when you were closer to the arm/sensor, the arm would move faster and vice versa.  Three coin pushers would push rocks into the middle, with the rocks acting as a metaphor of what qualities they bring to the table in the dating world. By having three coin pushers, there was an idea of competitiveness when they push each others rocks. The gravel in between the rocks signifies the rest of their qualities and personalities maybe even their \"baggage\". Online dating becomes very competitive and a place of numerous rejections, leading many to sadness. Through this project we wanted to prove hope for organic relationships which seem harder to come about. ",

After making our project, we noticed that the behaviour of the arm changed from competitve behaviour to also a rejection behaviour. The arms would move between themseleves pushing their rocks (rocks = what they had to offer in a relationship) to another arm, and the other arm would not react. We saw this as rejective behaviour. \n\nThe way you narrate and film your outcome is very important in the overall view of the project, it can change the way the viewer interperates the whole project.",

When the subject moves away from the sensor the magnet lowers its output until it is OFF, allowing the metal objects to revert back to individual behaviours. Using fabric stretched over an embroidery hoop and metal nuts we could visualise the change in behaviour as the nuts moved over the fabric in response to the electromagnet moving below the fabric.",
      "insights": "We found that the electromagnet, when connected to the potentiometer, was very sensitive and only slight changes in the output would lead to big jumps in the magnetism making it hard to find the perfect strength for the experiments. Additionally, the battery we were using ran out of charge after a number of uses indicating how much power was needed for the experiment to work effectively. We experimented with continuous magnetism as well as a delay loop which turned the magnet ON and OFF in quick succession. Both of these methods demonstrated our hypothesis well. Overall, we found our experiments worked well to illustrate our concept.",
      "title": "Using electromagnets and metal objects we can demonstrate behavioural changes from the individual to the collective. When the magnet is ON the objects work together as a collective, exhibiting behaviour as a mass. When the magnet is OFF the objects go back to their individual behaviours. This is similar to how groups of animals react to perceived threats in the wild .e.g. penguins huddling for warmth or schools of fish moving in unison for a better chance of survival against predators.",

      "final-proposition": "In response to our hypothesis exploring how smartphone use creates a cycle of dependency and influences cognitive processes, we have produced an interactive installation that embodies the psychological and physical tension between digital impulse and self-control.\n\nOur installation, titled \u201cThe Dopamine Loop\u201d,  seeks to offer participants a tangible experience of the struggle many face in controlling their smartphone usage. The machine itself is a mechanical device that simulates the dopamine loop inherent in smartphone interactions. Participants place their phones into the machine, and as they reach for the device, the machine begins to spin, resisting their attempt to take it. The more they try to reach for their phone, the harder it becomes, mimicking the increasing difficulty of maintaining focus in an environment of constant digital distractions.\n\nAs participants engage with the machine, they encounter a series of distractions, including simulated notifications, and sound effects. These serve to recreate the pervasive interruptions that smartphone users experience daily, reinforcing the tension between the desire to check the phone and the physical effort required to resist. The spinning mechanism, which gets increasingly difficult to counter, symbolises the growing addiction to instant gratification, mirroring the way smartphones perpetuate a cycle of desire and reward through notifications and algorithmic content.\nThrough this interactive experience, we aim to provoke participants to reflect on their own digital habits and the degree to which they may be trapped in a cycle of digital dependency. By physically manifesting the tension between impulse and resistance, the installation creates a visceral understanding of how easy it is to be pulled into a digital loop, and how hard it can be to break free.\n",
      "insights": "Through testing, we discovered that a solution where the phone is constantly just out of reach presents an intriguing approach. Rather than completely removing access to the device, it remains visible but inaccessible.\n\nThis design strikes a balance, allowing users to acknowledge their phone\u2019s activity without fully engaging in the cycle of checking and responding. It offers enough accessibility to remind users of their phone, but with enough restriction to prevent habitual use. The result is an experience that feels less corrective and more thought-provoking.\n\nThe physical act of attempting to reach for the phone\u2014only to have it move away\u2014subtly emphasises how often people feel compelled to engage with their devices. This interaction encourages users to reflect on their habits and could potentially lead to a lasting shift in their behaviour.\n\nUltimately, it became clear that our device isn\u2019t about complete restriction. Instead, it introduces a playful form of regulation that disrupts habitual phone use. While it may not fully solve the issue of dopamine addiction, it provides a tangible and engaging way to interrupt the cycle, fostering greater self-awareness and self-control.\n",

Like arcade machines, which use bright colours and reward systems (win/lose, scoring points, levels), this object would encourage the player to move faster against others in order to light up all of the pixels and make the motor spin first. Ideally, there would be at least 2 copies of the model for 2 players, to play into the competitive aspect. Several copies could be used to explore multiplayer dynamics, team play and time limits to alter behaviour. Regardless, the more people you are up against, the higher your engagement.",
      "insights": "1) Designing the game system to be as engaging as possible was interesting, as we had to keep the concept simple for repeatability.\n\n2) If we had more time, we would expand on the idea of the motor being the reward, perhaps by adding inflatable material to the propeller to increase the spectacle of winning.\n\n3) The idea of progression is also important in motivating people. We added rings to the model to incorporate this, but in hindsight we could have experimented more with light colour per level.\n\n",
      "title": "This is a study of how gamification affects our behaviour and how we interact with objects that are designed to make us more active and competitive. The behaviour we observe in this project would be the player, whilst our crafted outcome would be the stimuli.

      "final-proposition": "We began by discussing the difference in perceived behaviours between humans and computers. One key difference we delved into was the differences in resilience. Computers have no ability for self-reflection, and/or error correction and act repetitively to complete tasks. Simple tasks that are implemented into human everyday lives, such as walking, come as muscle memory and seem to occur automatically; other, more complex tasks can take time and multiple attempts. When we do an action or task repetitively, such as playing a game of tennis, our performance changes depending on how we view our own capabilities. \nWe began by discussing computers\u2019 repetitive loop cycle by creating a sensor-based chain reaction in the form of a Rube Goldberg machine. We also toyed with the idea of creating a humble robot that would gradually loose or gain confidence based on if a chain reaction it had \u2018initiated\u2019 went according to plan. The chain would gradually fall apart; intended to symbolize the self-destructive nature of the ego.  After imagining how we would realize both ideas, we decided to coin the saying \u201cI\u2019m losing my marbles\u201d as our title for a simple chain reaction using purely a ramp, marble and sensors. The marbles will gradually be released onto a ramp, falling through gaps onto sensors and levelling the ramp as each of them falls, so that the next marble may pass along further. The sensors send signals to a p5 animation displaying colourful dots, the signals enlarge the dots and play a sound.",
      "insights": "It can be difficult to create a structure using gravity that acts how you would expect it to act. Despite attempting to design the ramp so each marble would slot into the consecutive hole (we tested different inclines and eliminated any gaps on either side of said hole), the marbles were still able to jump over holes or get stuck between other marbles. ",
      "title": "Our project is a realization of the phrase \u201cI\u2019m losing my marbles\u201d. Computer programs run continuously, indefinitely unless they are instructed to stop. Ourselves, humans, act according to feeling. We behave in accordance with our ability, as well as the faith that we have in ourselves to complete any given task. If we are performing poorly at a task this can take a toll on our self-confidence at the detriment of our performance. If we have unaltered faith that we are strong at this same task we may act recklessly.  We do not have an equally distributed discipline because of our sense of self. ",

      "final-proposition": "The project is an interactive art installation inspired by the touch-me-not plant. When someone touches it, the \"plants\" respond by closing, as if they are shy or scared. This movement is made possible by using copper tape to sense touch and a motor to pull strings that close the plants. After a moment, the plants open back up to their original position.",
      "insights": "After scaling up the prototype, we realised that a single servo motor was not strong enough to make the plants close effectively. This highlighted the need for either multiple motors or a stronger motor to handle the increased load. When people interacted with the plant, they often described the closing motion as representing fear, anxiety, or shyness, which matched the intended emotions. Those familiar with touch-me-not plants recognised the connection between the behaviour of the installation and the natural plant.  \nIn the future, we would like to refine both the form and the mechanism of the installation. This could involve exploring more flexible materials for the plants, improving the movement system for smoother and more lifelike responses, and testing alternative mechanisms.",
      "title": "This project explores how humans interact with non-human entities that exhibit reactive, defensive behaviours through an interactive installation. Inspired by the \"touch me not\" plant, we examine the concept of personal boundaries and safe distances by creating a plant-like entity that \"hides\" when triggered by touch. The purpose is to investigate whether such interactions can evoke a sense of empathy or respect for boundaries in participants, as well as to analyse behavioural patterns\u2014whether individuals are more likely to leave the creature undisturbed or repeatedly provoke it.",

      "final-proposition": "We produced a kinetic sculpture, which represents somebody who did not receive consistent or reliable care in their developing years, and as a result has developed a disorganised attachment style. The sculpture consists of 5 synchronised DC motors, mounted in a wooden frame. The motors are connected to a proximity sensor. There are fabric toppers on the motors, to emphasise the movement clearly to the viewer. The sculpture showcases a disorganised attachment style on a physical level. As the viewer approaches, the sensor triggers a change in the movement of the motors. The motors desynchronise, changing directions, speeds and stopping/starting. The conflicting and chaotic behaviour represents the conflicting desires and behaviour that a person with disorganised attachment style may exhibit. The viewer represents somebody in the machine’s adult life trying to get close, but the machine cannot react calmly, similarly to how the disorganised-style human brain is ‘programmed’ to react the same way on an emotional level.",
      "insights": "We gained many insights during this project. We learned how respond appropriately to a brief, ensuring that we were not straying from the project criteria, while also being creative and inventive. The theorist gained valuable experience researching from academic sources, and highlighting relevant information. In terms of designing, we learned how to communicate and compromise, to ensure we were all happy with the creative direction of the project. On the making side, we experimented with new materials, such as wood. We learned how to realise our designed sketches into physical forms. We pushed ourselves on a technical level, building on top of what we learned in class. We experimented with different ways to control multiple DC motors, such as the LM298N or L293D motor drivers. This gave us a deeper understanding into physical computing and circuitry. We learned how to work as a team, promoting healthy group dynamics.",

      "insights": "The robot can produce unique and individual behaviours that are only applicable to friction and the combined weight of the components. The movement was enough to shake a table in my set up and had to be braced. Interestingly this caused the robot to behave depending on its environments stability.

This could be an extension of our concept, how does the object itself produce changes to the environment around it?",
