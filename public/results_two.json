The arms would move between themseleves pushing their rocks (rocks = what they had to offer in a relationship) to another arm, and the other arm would not react.

The machine itself is a mechanical device that simulates the dopamine loop inherent in smartphone interactions. Participants place their phones into the machine, and as they reach for the device, the machine begins to spin, resisting their attempt to take it. The more they try to reach for their phone, the harder it becomes, mimicking the increasing difficulty of maintaining focus in an environment of constant digital distractions.\n\nAs participants engage with the machine, they encounter a series of distractions, including simulated notifications, and sound effects. These serve to recreate the pervasive interruptions that smartphone users experience daily, reinforcing the tension between the desire to check the phone and the physical effort required to resist. The spinning mechanism, which gets increasingly difficult to counter, symbolises the growing addiction to instant gratification, mirroring the way smartphones perpetuate a cycle of desire and reward through notifications and algorithmic content.\nThrough this interactive experience, we aim to provoke participants to reflect on their own digital habits and the degree to which they may be trapped in a cycle of digital dependency. By physically manifesting the tension between impulse and resistance, the installation creates a visceral understanding of how easy it is to be pulled into a digital loop, and how hard it can be to break free.\n",
      "Describe any insights gained from your experiment": "Through testing, we discovered that a solution where the phone is constantly just out of reach presents an intriguing approach.

It offers enough accessibility to remind users of their phone, but with enough restriction to prevent habitual use. The result is an experience that feels less corrective and more thought-provoking.\n\nThe physical act of attempting to reach for the phone\u2014only to have it move away\u2014subtly emphasises how often people feel compelled to engage with their devices. This interaction encourages users to reflect on their habits and could potentially lead to a lasting shift in their behaviour.\n\nUltimately, it became clear that our device isn\u2019t about complete restriction. Instead, it introduces a playful form of regulation that disrupts habitual phone use. While it may not fully solve the issue of dopamine addiction, it provides a tangible and engaging way to interrupt the cycle, fostering greater self-awareness and self-control.\n",

Using a pen plotter programmed with p5.js, we simulate PDA by altering its behavior: when asked to perform a simple task, like drawing a smiley face, the plotter freezes or draws random lines instead. This physical demonstration mirrors the avoidance and emotional freeze responses common in PDA, offering a visual and interactive way to understand how individuals with PDA may struggle with seemingly ordinary demands.",

At first, the plotter is set to draw a smiley face, but when someone asks for it, the plotter \"avoids\" the task. Instead of drawing the smiley face, it freezes or scribbles random lines. This simulates the resistance and overwhelm that people with PDA often feel when asked to do something, offering a simple and physical way to understand their experience.",
