    "insights": "This project showed us how different peoples associations with colour and sound are. Although we did not get the chance to test it out on many people, the colour palettes seemed to be quite varied. It would be interesting to compare this data on a larger scale. It was nice to create a personalised experience, we wondered how we could take this further in the future by taking in sound as an input instead. In the future, we would also have to make it much clearer on how to interact with our project. ",

We wanted to further our project with varying wavelengths of light so users could also become more aware of the type of light they are being exposed to (which we felt was information that would be much more new for the audience).

As the colours change, they reshape the contours, mood, and atmosphere around the person, effectively transforming how they\u2019re perceived.

Its perceived radiance can be manipulated and altered by the user, who can adjust the rotational angles of each component.\nTo execute this idea, we modelled and 3D-printed unique attachments for servo motors, which fit custom-cut acrylic pieces. We stained the acrylic to add colour and also used mirror acrylic. The servo attachments also fit biconvex lenses, which we sourced.\nWe strategically created a floor plan which gave way to multiple permutations and combinations of light-constructing methods. We attached the servos to potentiometers, giving the user precise control over the components. We housed the electronics outside of the scaled-down model for practicality, but in a realised version, the user would walk through the room, changing each dial at each individual motor.\nThe idea of actively moving through the room gives way to embodied engagement with the environment. Not only does a user need to make physical efforts to construct environmental changes but their perception can also be changed due to simply standing in different locations.",
    "insights": " We gained multiple technical insights and learned the importance of accuracy in this project. We learned how to measure and match our component specifications, creating a suitable universal 3D model. We learned the process of 3D printing.

Normally, these tools become invisible in our lives, functioning as seamless interfaces through which we access the world. But when their outputs are changed\u2014whether it\u2019s light, heat, or sound\u2014it disrupts our automatic behaviours and makes us aware of how deeply integrated technology is in our perception of reality. Through this disruption, we open up a space for new forms of interaction, allowing us to rethink how we experience the world and our relationship with technology.",

Our maquettes are simple but very well convey the functions of these soul swapped items. A fire gun, heat lamp controller and remote control nail lamp. \nThe main task was hijacking the barcode scanner internals to operate as a key reader to transmit specific IR commands to a television. we used a python script that would take the barcode information, speak to an Arduino connected to the computer that would then encode and transmit that data through an IR LED - this process was far simpler on paper. IR encoding and receiving, python and Arduino interfacing, busy modems and serial ports all became very frustrating stop signs in the making process. In future,  a scanner that interfaces directly with the Arduino with a USB serial connection will skip the middle manning of a computer and simplify the process (which itself is an encoding of a message through barcode, decoded and sent through two scripts, recoded and transmitted through an IR to be received by a TV - a lot of jumping through windows when we can just use the door).",

    "final-proposition": "Final Work:\nFeel the Colours of the Knobs\n\nIn the previous experiment, we discovered that people don\u2019t share a common agree on the relationship on texture and colour(light). Also, different people have distinct perception on the colour of texture, especially people with synesthesia. In the final exhibition, the viewers were asked to walk in one by one to interact with the installation.\nBy touching, comparing, and turning the knobs, they picked the colour they thought about when interacting with the texture. \nThe colour range of each knob was determined in the previous experiment. We hope that this simple reaction can make people think about how we perceive the light, and how others\u2019 perception is so different to ours.",
    "insights": "Understanding that a stimulus could mean very different things to different people is important to design as we have to be able to pick the right colour and texture for our product.",
    "title": "Can we feel light in senses other than vision?\u00a0In this experiments, we explored our tactile relationship with light.\u00a0\u00a0 People have some preconceived ideas about what colours some objects are, for example danger being red, grass being green, sky being blue despite those not always being the true colours.\u00a0But, given an abstract texture stimulus, will people agree on what colour should be associated with it? Or will our perceptions of colour differ and be a personal thing?\u00a0 Hypothesis:\u00a0 We believe that there will be a correlation between the colour choices and the texture stimulus and that people will agree on the correct(same) colour.\u00a0",

    "final-proposition": "The goal of our project is to create a sense of wonder exploration, and introspection. We produced a virtual reality experience, we felt this type of layout for this experience was necessary to the effect we were trying to achieve. The first person experience in virtual reality already works to engage yet disorientate the viewer and we felt this worked best for the concepts we were trying to explore.",
    "insights": "We realised light and time have a lot more overlapping concepts than initially thought and this was super helpful to think about for doing a viewer centred piece for us.",
    "title": "Our project wanted to look at a virtual reality experience which was designed to immerse users in a dreamlike, otherworldly environment where time and reality blend into each other. We wanted to see how we could place the viewers into an unfamiliar realm in which their perception of time becomes warped. The primary objective is to explore and interact with mysterious beams of light, aiming to put viewers in a trance like state and lose track of time.",

    "final-proposition": "In a dark environment, a small white paper moth flaps its wings slowly, as more light shines on it, its wings flutter faster.\n\nusing LDR to input light level and a servo motor as output to animate the wings. When the light level increases, the speed of the motor turning would increase accordingly",
    "insights": "within the time we had, it was difficult to write code for more than one or two functions of the product, initially we wanted to try and make the moth move towards the light, however wiring two ldr inputs (for direction sensing), two dc motor outputs (for wheels), and building a housing and wheels for this was a bit ambitious,  to overcome this we instead fabricated an individual \u201cmoth\u201d that could be replicated with all of our arduinos to create multiple moths",
    "title": "When asked about our relationship to light, we considered the sensitivity that both humans and non-humans have to the increasing of artificial light sources that flood our lives.  An obvious example of the effect of artificial light on non-humans is the frenzied behaviour of insects, specifically moths which are drawn to streetlamps and the lights in our windows and display unusual flying patterns and behaviour.  We hypothesized that we could emulate this behaviour of increased activity in relation to increased levels of light using physical computing.",

    "final-proposition": "Our final proposition is a combination of two forms of prototyping around how light influences our perception and experience of home. The first is centred around speculative design and projecting the home of the future using AI. The maker experimented with different ways of building an immersive sensory experience through LED prototyping, audio input and projections.",
    "insights": "- the use of a state machine in code vs just loops as when moving between modes we first got stuck in while loops, realising we could use a switch statement was very helpful\n- the impact of different colours on our health was interesting, particularly that it is best to sleep in red light \n- the importance of prototyping in a project\n- looking at what the future of lighting could be with globalisation ",

    "final-proposition": "We have set up an environment where only one light is illuminated at a time and dims as they approach, you can observe whether individuals continue to move toward the lit area, indicating a natural inclination to seek light when in darkness. Using 2 ultrasonic sensors coded to dim as someone gets closer. We would have liked to make this larger scale and place in an empty room to better observe people reaction to the light and dark. ",
    "insights": "Our project was really valuable in understanding the depth of our relation to light, we initially found that there were so many pathways we could have gone down but where able to make a decision. We also were surprised by how quickly we were able to interate through coding, as well as prototyping, really helpful in gaining an understanding of how to move forward. I would love to have some more time to refine these ideas and maybe scale them up. ",
    "title": "If a person is placed in a dark room with alternating dimming light sources, then they will instinctively move toward the illuminated light source, driven by an innate attraction to light as a perceived safe area in the darkness. This hypothesis builds on the concept that humans may be naturally drawn to light in dark settings, possibly as a remnant of evolutionary survival mechanisms.",

    "final-proposition": "We produced a board that once a specific light is shown, this would light up the respected LED, effectively transferring the light, to bring the plant to life by spiraling upwards. Light towards the red end of the spectrum has a longer wavelength and lower energy as compared to the violet end of the spectrum, which will impact the plant.",
    "insights": "Overall, our group worked cohesively and productively by considering time  constraints and vast difference of opinions.\n\nWe formed a suitable rudiment which implemented all of our findings; no one\u2019s concept was left out, rather built upon to strengthen our foundation.\n\nComing from different majors, it was insightful to collaborate with an array of perspectives within the creative realm, which grew our knowledge and communication.",
    "title": "Our concept/hypothesis included the focus on bioluminescence; by combining colour theory and light intensity which alters our relationship with light. This branches to our question, how does bioluminescence use different coloured lights to alter behaviour in surrounding organisms?",
