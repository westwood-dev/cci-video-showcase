# CCI Video Submission Showcase Website

## Description

This website is a showcase for student project submissions. Videos are submitted by students via MS forms and processed with two Python scripts, one for compressing, reformatting and generating thumbnails from the videos, and the other is for migrating the data from the MS Forms xcel format to a JSON format.

The website is built with Nuxt, and built and deployed with Github Actions and Github Pages. Accessible [here](https://cci.wwstwd.studio/).

## Notes

The student work is submitted and hosted with explicit permission to be used and showcased on this website. Rights to the work remain with the students and UAL.
